    "In today's increasingly interconnected world, collaboration is key. You'll most certainly work with someone who doesn't use Stata, but Python or R, for example. So, how can you ensure seamless collaboration in such situations? In this chapter, we'll discuss strategies and best practices for cross-platform collaboration. We'll delve into the use of common data formats, version control systems, and other tools that can ease the process. Moreover, we'll briefly touch upon how artificial intelligence, especially tools like OpenAI's GPT, can facilitate your programming journey"
