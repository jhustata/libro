    "# Session 6: Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "This week is dedicated to a hands-on session where you get to apply the concepts you've learned so far to a real-world case study. We will provide a dataset related to clinical investigation and guide you on how to perform one-way, two-way, and multivariable analyses, hierarchical models. \n",
