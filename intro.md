# Preface

This book has been designed to cater to students with low, moderate, or advanced skill-levels without overwhelming or boring those in the tails of this beautiful spectrum. 

Since the book also aims to keep each student sufficiently engaged from the first week through to the end, you should expect to find pacesetters along your journey, letting you keep on target with your goals.

In the spirit of openness, the book will also lay out a rubric that lets you know how you'll be graded each week.

Expect to feel anxious, bored, or [flow](flow.ipynb) at some point. Flow is a psychological state of `being in the zone`, characterized by optimal engagement and enjoyment. It is when your skill level is well-matched to the challenge levels you face.

Our goal is to start off with low challenge levels and gradually increase these levels each week. At each challenge level there'll be material tailored to those with low skill-, moderate skill-, and high skill levels.

You'll find that we sufficiently equip you with the tools that renable you to remain `in the zone` throughout this class.

Feedback systems are the only means by which we may hope to achieve this. And so we'll ask you to submit your responses to a weekly task by 11:59PM on Mondays.

Although this is not a statistics class, some very basic idea regarding summary estimates such as mean, standard deviation, or percentile are expected.

ChatGPT or any AI will exponentiate the rate at which you learn, solve problems, and meet challenges including timely submission of homeworks.

But we'll still hold office hours to maintain the human touch in-person, via-zoom, or by a hybrid arrangement. 

Please use this books [Hub](hub.ipynb) to find the resources you'll need during your journey through Stata Programming at JHU.

Looking forward to meeting you, guiding you, learning from you, and forging away at Stata Programming with you!
