    "# Session 3: Multivariable\n",
    "\n",
    "Multivariable analysis typically involves working with multiple independent variables to understand their impact on a dependent variable. Often, we use parametric methods for this analysis as they provide a useful framework when the assumptions of these methods are met. However, in cases where the assumptions of parametric methods are not met, semi-parametric methods can be helpful. Unfortunately, non-parametric methods are not well-suited for multivariable analysis due to their limitations in handling multiple independent variables. In this chapter, we'll focus on parametric and semi-parametric methods, exploring how they can be used in Stata  \n",
