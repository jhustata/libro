    "# Session 8: Review and Exam Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Dedicate this week to review and exam preparation. Summarize the key points of the course, address any pending queries or doubts, and provide study materials or guides to help students in their exam preparation. You could also conduct mock tests to give them a feel of the actual exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Host a Capstone Project Presentation or Peer Review Session:  \n",
    "If your course includes a capstone project or final assignment, make the last session a time where students present their projects to the class. Alternatively, it could be a peer review session where students provide feedback on each other's projects. This not only encourages attendance, but also active participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Organize an Expert Guest Lecture or Panel Discussion:  \n",
    "Invite industry professionals or academic experts for a guest lecture or panel discussion. They can talk about real-world applications of Stata programming, discuss current trends in the field, or even share their career journey and provide valuable advice. This can be a motivating factor for students to attend.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Conduct a Workshop on Advanced Topics or Career Guidance:  \n",
    "A workshop on an advanced topic of interest related to Stata programming or a session on career guidance, resume building, and job search strategies could also attract students.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Provide Extra Credit or Recognition:  \n",
    "Offer extra credit for those who attend and participate in the last session. Alternatively, provide some form of recognition, like a certificate of completion or a digital badge, that students can add to their resume or LinkedIn profile.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Schedule a Course Wrap-up and Reflection Session:  \n",
    "Use this time for students to reflect on what they've learned, discuss their experiences, and give feedback on the course. You could also summarize key course takeaways and provide resources for further learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Make it a Fun and Relaxing Session:  \n",
    "After weeks of intense learning, a lighter, more fun session could be a welcome change. Consider incorporating educational games, quizzes, or even a small virtual celebration to mark the end of the course.  \n"
